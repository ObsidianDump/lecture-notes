Abstract Data Types ([[ADT]]) are a set of well defined values and operations, *abstracting* out a given section of code to its pure function. This allows for high cohesion and low coupling with subroutines and functions that provide the same job but with different methods to be easily swapped without fearing the integrity of the rest of the program, or without needing to restructure/redesign other sections of the code.
